# Password-Safe-Script
Portfolio
This a script that joins the use of python code, sqlite3 and bash Scripts, for the first time the script will check if there are a python code to generate random password and if there is a data base to store the information into and if not it will create both of files.
The user will have two options either to make a new one or search for an existing one and in both cases he will be asked for the password to confirm ownership and only if confirmed he will be able to add or search.
As in the future the addition of more security layers is a must.
